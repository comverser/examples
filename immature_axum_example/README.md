# Immature Axum Example

## Development Guide

This guide provides resources for setting up a todo app in Rust. For detailed instructions, please refer to:

To streamline your development process, consider using [Cargo Watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch). This utility automatically runs specified commands when files change, which is especially useful for recompiling your code or running tests whenever you save a file.

Install `cargo watch` with the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
```

Once installed, you can use `cargo watch` to automatically recompile your code and restart your server whenever you save a file:

```bash
cargo watch -x run
```

For standardized commit messages, we recommend using Commitizen. More information can be found in the official Commitizen Tools documentation:

## Database

```bash
sea-orm-cli generate entity -o src/database/
```
