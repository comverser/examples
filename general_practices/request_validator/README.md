This repository contains source code from a YouTube lecture. The lecture can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Zm3jKlnta58).

## Overview

This system ensures that incoming requests meet specified criteria before they are processed by the application.

## Project Structure

- `main.rs`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the routes and integrates the request validation middleware.
- `validator.rs`: Contains the validation logic and rules for incoming requests.
- `model.rs`: Defines the data structures used in the application.
